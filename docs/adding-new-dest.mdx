title: "Adding New Observability Destination"
---

There are tens if not hundreds of different observability destinations. Odigos
goal is to provide a seamless and easy way to ship observability data to any one
of them.

In this guide, you will learn how to contribute a new destination to Odigos. We
will create a new dummy destination called `mydest`. Creating a new destination
involves two steps:

1. Extending the UI for the new destination
2. Adding the collector configuration for the new destination

## User Interface

For our new destination to be visible in the UI, we need to make several changes
to the UI code:

1. Go to `ui/img/vendor` directory and add your logo file, for example
   `mydest.svg`. Please use svg format for the logo.
2. Go to `ui/vendors` directory and create a new file called `mydest.tsx`.
3. Start by adding the required import statements (Notice that line 6 points to
   the file you created in step 1).

```js
import {
  ObservabilityVendor,
  ObservabilitySignals,
  VendorObjects,
} from "@/vendors/index";
import MyDestLogo from "@/img/vendor/mydest.svg";
import { NextApiRequest } from "next";
```

4. Create a class called `MyDest` that implements the `ObservabilityVendor`
   interface:

```js
export class MyDest implements ObservabilityVendor {
  name = "mydest";
  displayName = "My Destination";
  supportedSignals = [ObservabilitySignals.Traces, ObservabilitySignals.Metrics];

  getLogo = (props: any) => {
    return <MyDestLogo {...props} />;
  };
```

Everything should be self-explanatory. Specify the name (unique lowercase
string) of the destination, the display name (human-readable string) and the
observability signals your destination supports. The `getLogo` method should
return a React component that will be used as the logo for the destination.

5. Specify the required fields for communicating with the destination by
   implementing the `getFields` method:

```js
getFields = () => {
  return [
    {
      displayName: "URL",
      id: "url",
      name: "url",
      type: "url",
    },
    {
      displayName: "Region",
      id: "region",
      name: "region",
      type: "text",
    },
    {
      displayName: "API Key",
      id: "apikey",
      name: "apikey",
      type: "password",
    },
  ];
};
```

This method returns an array of `IDestField` objects. The `type` field
corresponds to the type of input field that will be displayed in the UI.

6. Add the method `toObjects`. This method converts the data received from the
   UI to the data that will be persisted in the Kubernetes data store. Each
   destination can have nonsecret data (like region) - defined in the `Data`
   field of the returned object and secret data (like API key) - defined in the
   `Secret` field of the returned object.

```ts
toObjects = (req: NextApiRequest) => {
  return {
    Data: {
      MYDEST_URL: req.body.url,
      MYDEST_REGION: req.body.region,
    },
    Secret: {
      MYDEST_API_KEY: Buffer.from(req.body.apikey).toString("base64"),
    },
  };
};
```

<Note>
  Notice that Kubernetes requires that the secret data be base64 encoded.
</Note>

7. Add the method `mapDataToFields` which converts the data received from the
   Kubernetes data store to the data that will be displayed in the UI. This
   method is invoked when user edits the destination in the UI.

```ts
mapDataToFields = (data: any) => {
  return {
    url: data.MYDEST_URL,
    region: data.MYDEST_REGION,
  };
};
```

8. Finally, register the destination you just created by modifying
   `theui/vendors/index.ts` file:

```js
// Add an import for the new destination
import { MyDest } from "@/vendors/mydest";

// Add the new destination to the list of vendors
const Vendors = [/* List of existing vendors... */ new MyDest()];
```

For a complete UI implementation example, see
[one of our existing vendors](https://github.com/odigos-io/odigos/tree/main/ui/vendors).

## Collector Configuration

Now that our new vendor can be persisted/loaded in the Kubernetes data store, we
need to implement the collector configuration.

1. Go to `common/dests.go` and add your new destination to the `DestinationType`
   enum. Make sure the value is the same as the `name` property of the
   destination UI class.
2. Go to `autoscaler/controllers/gateway/config` directory and create a new file
   called `mydest.go` with the following content:

```go
package config

import (
	odigosv1 "github.com/odigos-io/odigos/api/v1alpha1"
	commonconf "github.com/odigos-io/odigos/autoscaler/controllers/common"
	"github.com/odigos-io/odigos/common"
)

type MyDest struct{}

func (m *MyDest) DestType() common.DestinationType {
	return common.MyDestDestinationType
}

func (m *MyDest) ModifyConfig(dest *odigosv1.Destination, currentConfig *commonconf.Config) {
    // Modify the config here
    	if isTracingEnabled(dest) {
		currentConfig.Exporters["otlp/mydest"] = commonconf.GenericMap{
			"endpoint": "https://mydest.com:4317",
			"headers": commonconf.GenericMap{
				"x-mydest-header-apikey": "${MYDEST_API_KEY}",
			},
		}

		currentConfig.Service.Pipelines["traces/mydest"] = commonconf.Pipeline{
			Exporters:  []string{"otlp/mydest"},
		}
	}
}
```

- The method `DestType` returns the enum value of the destination added earlier.
- The method `ModifyConfig` is called with the `dest` object which holds the
  data received from the UI and the `currentConfig` object. The `currentConfig`
  object contains the current configuration of the gateway collector. Modify
  this object to include the
  [OpenTelemetry configuration](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/)
  needed by your destination. Make sure to give any exporter or pipeline a
  unique name in order to avoid conflicts (use the convention
  `traces/<dest-name>` for traces pipelines and `otlp/<dest-name>` for
  OpenTelemetry exporters). You can assume a basic configuration is already
  provided in the `currentConfig` object, for details see `getBasicConfig`
  method in autoscaler/controllers/gateway/config/root.go file.
- You can use the utility methods `isTracingEnabled`, `isMetricsEnabled` and
  `isLoggingEnabled` to determine which signals are selected by the user for the
  destination and configure the collector accordingly.
- The last step is to register the new destination struct in the
  `autoscaler/controllers/gateway/config/root.go` file:

```go
var availableConfigers = []Configer{/* List of existing destinations  */, &MyDest{}}
```

Thatâ€™s it! Now you can use your new destination in the UI and send data to it.

**Please submit a PR to the
[odigos git repository](https://github.com/odigos-io/odigos), we are happy to
accept new destinations.**
