Odigos is an [open-source](https://github.com/odigos-io/odigos) observability control plane.
The project's two main goals are:

1. **Automatic instrumentation** - Odigos automatically instruments your
   applications and produces distributed traces and metrics **without any code changes**.
2. **Collector management** - Odigos automatically deploys and scales collectors according to application traffic. No need to
   spend time deploying and configuring collectors.

#### Adopt OpenTelemetry in minutes
Odigos currently supports all the popular managed and open source destinations.
By producing data in the [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io) format, Odigos can be used with any observability tool that supports OTLP
and allow you to easily switch to another vendor in the future.

## Who is Odigos for?

- **Application developers** - focus on writing code. Odigos leverages the
  power of OpenTelemetry and eBPF to automatically instrument applications.
  Be prepared for the next production incident with best-in-class observability data.

- **Platform engineers** - Odigos automatically deploys and scales collectors according to the traffic of applications.
  No need to waste time deploying and configuring collectors.

<Note>
The name Odigos originates from Greek, meaning guide.
